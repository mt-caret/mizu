# Mizu

> 上善若水

![CI](https://github.com/mt-caret/mizu/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Mizu is an experiment to explore what secure, private, and asynchronous
messaging might look like when backed by a decentralized store (Tezos).
Mizu is similar to email combined with PGP, while being forward secret and
tries to reduce information leakage, similar to
[Pond](https://web.archive.org/web/20151101081526/https://pond.imperialviolet.org/).

**DISCLAIMER**: The design and implementation of Mizu is done by
non-cryptographers who have not had substantial experience designing or
implementing security-critical communication protocols. Please do not use
this for anything real yet.
